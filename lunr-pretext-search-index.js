If and are real numbers, the absolute value of their difference, denoted , is the distance between and on the number line.  Adding numbers with like signs To add two real numbers with like signs (both positive or both negative), add their magnitudes (absolute values), then prefix their common sign.  Adding numbers with unlike signs To add two real numbers with unlike signs (one positive and one negative), subtract the number with the smaller magnitude (absolute value) from the number with the larger magnitude, then prefix the sign of the number with the larger magnitude.  Subtracting Subtracting is identical to adding the opposite of :  Multiplying and dividing numbers with like signs The product and quotient of two real numbers with like signs are positive.  Multiplying and dividing numbers with unlike signs The product and quotient of two real numbers with unlike signs are negative.  Exponents If is a real number and is a whole number, then  Odd or even exponents A negative real number raised to an even exponent is positive, while a negative real number raised to an odd exponent is negative.
